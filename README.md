# long-exposure
This was forked off of [an older long-exposure project (not mine)](https://github.com/unixpickle/long-exposure) which used the webcam to take snapshots that simulated slightly longer exposure times by grabbing frames from a webcam stream and superimposing them.

This repo updates the code a bit and adds some controls to let you produce a gambit of long-exposure photographs using your webcam.
